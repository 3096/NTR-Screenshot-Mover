# NTR-Screenshot-Mover
A simple 3DS homebrew app to move NTR Screenshots out of SD root directory.

## To do list:

- Actually move something.
- Detect time of when the file is created for naming

## Planned features, no guarantee:

- Combine top and bottom screen
- Convert to png format (I think I saw a png lib, not sure if it can do this tho)
- Gallery style preview
